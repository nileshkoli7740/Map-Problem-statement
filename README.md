# Map-Problem-statement
We can use the Python built-in function map() to apply a function to each item in an iterable (like a list or dictionary) and return a new iterator for retrieving the results. map() returns a map object (an iterator), which we can use in other parts of our program. We can also pass the map object to the list() function, or another sequence type, to create an iterable.
